<hr class="aitf">

<div class="allsc">MY DEAR GIRLS AND BOYS,</div>

<p><span class="smc">If</span> “The Eagle’s Masque” should afford you half
the pleasure which I have myself received from “The
Peacock at Home,” I will make no further demands upon
your approbation.</p>

<p>My Brothers and Sisters in this line of literature are
accustomed to distinguish particular passages in their
poems by remarks, or explanations at the bottom of the
page.—I do not intend, however, to follow their example.
What I wish is, that you should first get through all your
laughing, without interruption; reserving for you afterwards the useful
amusement of picking out further information for yourselves,
as you will find it in those books of
<a id="pgiv" href="#pgiv"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>iv<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Natural History, with coloured figures, which your Parents,
or Tutors, will have the goodness to lay before you
for that purpose.</p>

<p>In the next place, I have great pride, and pleasure,
in being able to assure you, that I have not, in a single
instance, knowingly set down any circumstance relating,
in a <em>general</em> way, to the persons, lives, and manners,
of my feathered Characters, which you may not find to
be strictly true. If some cases should occur, in which this
assertion may puzzle, or surprize you, your kind friends
above mentioned will make the proper distinctions for you;
and then, you will find every thing as it should be.</p>

<p class="nobrk">And so, recommending my Birds, and myself, to your
favour and protection,</p>

<div class="lt8 nobrk">  I remain</div>
<div class="lt10 nobrk">    your affectionate Friend,</div>
<div class="rt1 nobrk">      and Play-fellow,</div>
<div class="rt">        TOM TIT.</div>

<small>THE</small><br
 >EAGLE’S MASQUE.</h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div><span class="Initial">W</span>HEN “The Butterfly’s Ball,” and the “Grass-hopper’s Feast,”</div>
<div>Had resounded abroad from the west to the east,</div>
<div>The <i>Peacock</i>, whose bosom is vanity’s station,</div>
<div>In a trice was “At Home” to the feather’d <span class="nw">Creation.—</span></div>
<div>The trumpet of Fame was more active than ever:</div>
<div>The Gala so gay!—the arrangements <span class="nw">so clever!—</span></div>
<div class="tri1">The Genius of Mirth flew in every direction;</div>
<div class="tri2">The Queen on her ... cliff caught the raging infection,</div>
<div class="tri3">And joy flourished under the royal protection.</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">      </span>Soon, the Birds, cock-a-hoop at the call of their betters,</div>
<div>To Court were invited by circular letters:</div>
<div>The <i>Pigeon</i> in waiting flew round, and display’d</div>
<div>“<i>Queen Eagle sends Greeting</i>—<span class="smc">A Grand Masquerade</span>.”</div>
<div>Of a grand Masquerade not a notion had <span class="nw">they—</span></div>
<div>And Birds are as curious as Ladies, they say.</div>
<div>What impatience was felt to be ready and drest!</div>
<div>Not a bird, nor a birdling could sleep in her nest.</div>
<div>What fighting for Characters!—shifting of plumes!</div>
<div>How the <span class="smc">Raven</span> desponds, and the <span class="smc">Peacock</span> presumes!</div>
<div class="i1"><a id="pg6" href="#pg6"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>6<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span class="ns">      </span>At length ’tis arriv’d—the grand, critical Night!</div>
<div>And by thousands they throng to the scene of delight.</div>
<div>Not a fowl staid at home that had spirits, or <span class="nw">wings—</span></div>
<div>Every Biped was there that pecks, flutters, or sings.</div>
<div>The Empress received them with affable grace,</div>
<div>In an Aviary built at her favourite Place;</div>
<div>Though, ’twas notic’d, she coldly accosted the <span class="smc">Gull</span>,</div>
<div>Who had guarded some sheep from her Majesty’s pull.</div>
<div>But here—as <i>incog.</i> was the word—you may ask,</div>
<div>How the Queen knew the Gull, notwithstanding his mask?</div>
<div>Why, an Eagle looks sharper than I, or than you, Sir,</div>
<div>And, without any spectacles, knows who is who, Sir.</div>
<div>Each Masquer, in order presented, fell flat.</div>
<div>And the <span class="smc">Cardinal</span> lifted his claw to his <em>hat</em>.</div>
<div>First compliments over, the Revels are <span class="nw">brewing—</span></div>
<div>Assist me, O Proteus! to tell what was doing,</div>
<div>While Birds of all feathers, all habits, all sizes,</div>
<div>All tongues, and all climates, were met in disguises.</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">      </span>First the huge <span class="smc">Albatross</span>, with his crony, the <span class="smc">Penguin</span>,</div>
<div>(Like most other sea-faring folk, over sanguine)</div>
<div>Had hop’d their identity nicely to veil,</div>
<div>By attempting the waddle and cry of the <span class="smc">Quail</span>.</div>
<div>Not to mention the <span class="smc">Manakin</span>, too—little varlet!</div>
<div>Who, because he was born to be crested with scarlet,</div>
<div>And wears a blue spencer, so sparkish and <span class="nw">glossy,—</span></div>
<div>Not satisfied thus to look handsome and saucy,</div>
</div></div>

 </span></span></a>The <em>helmet</em> put on of the great <span class="smc">Cassowary</span>,</div>
<div>So fierce!—you’d have back’d him to fight with a Fairy,</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Booby</span>, by nature a blockhead confest,</div>
<div>In the top-knot and train of the <span class="smc">Peacock</span> was drest;</div>
<div>But of all whom the stratagem aim’d to seduce,</div>
<div>He could make but two converts—the <span class="smc">Gull</span> and the <span class="smc">Goose</span>.</div>
<div class="tri1">The said Goose, with her distant Relation, <span class="smc">Goosander</span>,</div>
<div class="tri2">(As the husband of each was afraid to command her,)</div>
<div class="tri3">Wore the breeches ... I mean, wore the garb, of the <span class="smc">Gander</span>.</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Coot</span>, and the <span class="smc">Curlew</span>, the <span class="smc">Mallard</span>, and <span class="smc">Teal</span>,</div>
<div>(For once, and for ever, their names to conceal,)</div>
<div>To the <span class="smc">Razor-bill</span> went with a singular <span class="nw">suit—</span></div>
<div>That the webs he would slit of each membranous foot;</div>
<div>From a cunning conceit that the length of their toes</div>
<div>Would throw dust in the eyes of their natural foes.</div>
<div>“The chief reason,” said they, “why the favor we ask ye,</div>
<div>Is because, as we hear, little Count Borowlaski</div>
<div>Last night, for a Pigmy, was chas’d by a <span class="smc">Crane</span>,</div>
<div>But, by standing on tip-toe, escap’d being slain;</div>
<div>And it matters but little, since life is so sweet,</div>
<div>If we save it by slitting, or stretching, our feet.”</div>
<div class="tri1">The <span class="smc">Buzzard</span>,—a mighty weak kind of a fowl,</div>
<div class="tri2">Hit on no better method of seeming an <span class="smc">Owl</span>,</div>
<div class="tri3">Than by catching a Mouse, and affecting to howl.</div>
<div><a id="pg8" href="#pg8"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>The <span class="smc">Butcher-bird</span>, too, changing battle for love,</div>
<div>In the plumes of a <span class="smc">Pigeon</span>, made up to a dove:</div>
<div>He could manage the billing, though out in the <span class="nw">cooing—</span></div>
<div>As well might a <em>Kitten</em> sham <em>Cow</em> ... and be mooing!</div>
<div>But his dove in a twinkling escap’d from his view,</div>
<div>And return’d, in the crest of a fierce <span class="smc">Cockatoo</span>:</div>
<div>Whilst ye, tiny <span class="smc">Tits</span>!—both the <em>lark</em>, and the <em class="nw">mouse—</em></div>
<div>Drest your legs up in feathers, and call’d yourselves <span class="smc">Grouse</span>.</div>
<div>But it would surely have forc’d an old hermit to laugh,</div>
<div>Had he seen the gay <span class="smc">Finches</span>,—<em>gold</em>, <em>green</em>, <em>bull</em>, and <em>chaff</em>,</div>
<div>By vanity blinded, and panting for praise,</div>
<div>As <span class="smc">Swans</span>, or as <span class="smc">Turkeycocks</span>, dancing the hays!</div>
<div>Conceive, too—but I can’t conceive it if you can,</div>
<div>Little <span class="smc">Wren</span> bending under the beak of the <span class="smc">Toucan</span>!</div>
<div>While the Toucan himself, though an hundred times bigger,</div>
<div>Votes his own bill a bore,—as you’ll easily figure.</div>
<div>Not a bird of the air can you bring me whose belly</div>
<div>Can half as much hold as the pouch of the <span class="smc">Peli</span>-</div>
<div><span class="smc">Can</span>:—yet in despite of his size and his maw,</div>
<div>(’Twas in vain to object) he <em>would</em> come as a <span class="smc">Daw</span>!</div>
<div class="tri1">And what shall we think of the <span class="smc">Nightingale’s</span> folly,</div>
<div class="tri2">Who, no longer “most musical, most melancholy,”</div>
<div class="tri3">A green Domino wore, and kept screaming “poor Polly!”</div>
<div>Whilst <span class="smc">Poll</span> was like other pragmatical Youngsters,</div>
<div>Who, because they are talkers, must set up for songsters.</div>

<div>Who, in spite of his person and outlandish lingo,</div>
<div>His spindles close up to his body is buckling,</div>
<div>To fit on in their stead the squab legs of a <span class="smc">Duckling</span>!</div>
<div class="tri1">He came from the banks of the fam’d Oroonoko,</div>
<div class="tri2">But in mix’d conversation, was dull as the <span class="smc">Cuckoo</span>,</div>
<div class="tri3">For, say just what you would, he still answer’d “tocoko!”</div>
<div>But the <span class="smc">Barnacle</span> best play’d his part at our Masque;</div>
<div>“The Barnacle!—how?”—Yes, I thought you would ask:</div>
<div class="tri1">Why, he look’d like himself, to be sure, but, to boot,</div>
<div class="tri2">Might be taken for <span class="smc">Gander</span>, <span class="smc">Drake</span>, <span class="smc">Puffin</span>, or <span class="smc nw">Coot;—</span></div>
<div class="tri3">So he spar’d the expence of a Masquerade <span class="nw">suit.—</span></div>
<div>If any one there could be odder than that,</div>
<div>’Twas that leathery, feathery mongrel, the <span class="smc">Bat</span>,</div>
<div>Who, when told that no ticket admitted a <em class="nw">Mouse,—</em></div>
<div>Took huff as a <em>bird</em>, and flew out of the house.</div>
<div class="tri1">The <i>Flying-fish</i>, too, shall come in for his share,</div>
<div class="tri2">Who in haste from the ocean contriv’d to be there,</div>
<div class="tri3">Just to make the <i>Bird-fanciers</i> puzzle and stare.</div>
<div>But see from the mountains of Scotland, the <span class="smc nw">Ousel—</span></div>
<div>Our motley community bent to <span class="nw">bamboozle—</span></div>
<div>Doff his crest, and look <em>sharp</em>, in the bill of a <span class="smc">Snipe</span>,</div>
<div>Though to mimick the <em>whistle’s</em> too much for his pipe.</div>
<div>Next, the <span class="smc">Ptarmigan</span> plenty of ridicule draws;</div>
<div>For, though booted with feathers quite down to his claws,</div>
<div><a id="pg10" href="#pg10"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Yet, neglecting to shave them,—neglecting to gather,</div>
<div>In support of his part, one appropriate feather,</div>
<div>The lubberly Simpleton hopes he may pass</div>

<div>To take leave of this marvellous Meeting of Birds;</div>
<div>Who, from flying or walking, now sat down at table</div>
<div>To a <i>Pic-nic</i> provided as each one was able.</div>
<div class="tri1">As the Guests were domestic—erratic—aquatic,</div>
<div class="tri2">The dishes were various, the feeders ecstatic,</div>
<div class="tri3">And the salt, too, that season’d the supper was Attic.</div>
<div>The fish were delightfully drest by the <i>Cook</i>,</div>
<div>Whom for this very purpose, without line or hook,</div>
<div>In the shallows of Cornwall, the <span class="smc">Pelican</span> took.</div>
<div>In a party so large you must easily think</div>
<div>Some dissentions arose about victuals and drink.</div>
<div class="tri1">Thus, the tongues of the delicate all were at work,</div>
<div class="tri2">In abusing that foul-feeding savage the <span class="smc">Stork</span>,</div>
<div class="tri3">For harpooning live frogs with his double-prong’d fork;</div>
<div>While the <span class="smc">Bustard</span> by few was esteem’d over nice,</div>
<div>For supping so sweetly on moles, and on mice.</div>
<div>Then, the lovers of salad were fuming and huffing,</div>
<div>At the very bad oil introduc’d by the <span class="smc">Puffin</span>.</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Blackbird</span>, beside, rais’d a host of deriders,</div>
<div>For piling his plate up with dozens of spiders.</div>
<div class="tri1">But the <span class="smc">Pelican</span> most was detested by all;</div>
<div class="tri2">For the fish shovell’d into her pouch at a haul</div>
<div class="tri3">Would have set up a moderate Fishmonger’s stall:</div>
<div><a id="pg22" href="#pg22"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>22<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Yet the herrings thus pack’d in her natural barrel</div>
<div>(’Twas <em>this</em> that provok’d all the clamour and quarrel)</div>
<div>She dreams not of eating—far less of <span class="nw">digesting—</span></div>
<div>Till her leisure shall serve, while her babies are resting.</div>
<div>No Pelican’s perfect, I grant:—what of <span class="nw">that?—</span></div>
<div>She’s the best, <em>very</em> best, of all Mothers, that’s flat.</div>
<div>For what other Mamma keeps a tap of good blood</div>
<div>Running out at her breast for her family’s <span class="nw">good?—</span></div>
<div>But among all the gluttons that peck’d at the feast,</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Hern</span> and the <span class="smc">Cormorant</span> lik’d themselves least;</div>
<div>For both, though with ev’ry fair right to be <span class="nw">burst,—</span></div>
<div>Poor things!—were as lanky at last as at first!</div>
<div>Yet the Parrot seem’d most incommoded at supper,</div>
<div>So much was her under lip cramp’d by the upper.</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Ostrich</span> was long but a mere stander-by,</div>
<div>While his bowels would dismally grumble and cry.</div>
<div>Such digestible dainties <em>his</em> stomach <span class="nw">rejected:—</span></div>
<div>Never yet was, for him, a worse supper selected!</div>
<div>So he pick’d a few stones which the place did inviron,</div>
<div>Which he crumbled as bread in a nice mess of iron.</div>
<div>“A supper of iron!—pray, Sir, was it <em>hot</em>?”</div>
<div>No, my arch little rogue—I should think it was not.</div>
<div>“But how did he get it, Sir?”—How!—what a question!</div>
<div>You’d better have ask’d how he got the digestion:</div>
<div class="tri1">For the <em>stuff</em>—that’s a matter he easily settles;</div>
<div class="tri2">For instance—<em>our</em> Ostrich despising the victuals,</div>
<div class="tri3">Fell to kissing the cook for the pots and the kettles.</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">      </span><a id="pg23" href="#pg23"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>23<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a><span class="ns">      </span>While thus they were lining and moist’ning their clay,</div>
<div>A choice Band of performers were piping away.</div>
<div>But, as most knew the natural notes of the rest,</div>
<div>It was voted by all—<em>Imitations</em> were best.</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Black-cap</span>, who often had plac’d himself snug,</div>
<div>For the purpose of catching the <span class="smc">Nightingale’s</span> jug,</div>
<div>Had listen’d so closely, and learnt it so pat,</div>
<div>He was dubb’d the <i>mock Nightingale</i>, merely for <span class="nw">that:—</span></div>
<div>So he jugg’d, and he trill’d, and he quaver’d so pretty,</div>
<div>That his Master himself hardly knew his own ditty.</div>
<div>Yet one thing in dudgeon the company <span class="nw">took—</span></div>
<div>An occasional bass from the <span class="smc">Raven</span>, or <span class="smc">Rook</span>;</div>
<div>Though the gravest were somewhat to laughter inclin’d,</div>
<div>As the <span class="smc">Wag-tail</span> kept time by a jerk from <span class="nw">behind.—</span></div>
<div>Then, the <span class="smc">Bulfinch</span> began—and ’tis well he was taught,</div>
<div>For the note he was born to, is not worth a groat:</div>
<div>But he prov’d an apt scholar; and soon, not a tone</div>
<div>Nor an air cou’d he hear, but he made it his <span class="nw">own.—</span></div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Gold-finch</span>, a qualified <em>Treble</em>, was there,</div>
<div>And was prest to exhibit—but, though you may stare,</div>
<div>This puppy preferr’d the whole ev’ning to pass,</div>
<div>In prinking and dressing his plumes at the glass.</div>
<div>But soon in the place of this pert little Antic,</div>
<div>Rose a Singer of note from across the Atlantic;</div>
<div>The <span class="smc">Mock-bird</span>—who beat all competitors hollow,</div>
<div>By leading, where none had the courage to follow.</div>
<div><a id="pg24" href="#pg24"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>24<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Not content, like his mimicking sisters and brothers,</div>
<div>To go out of himself, and to personate others,</div>
<div class="tri1">He ravish’d all ears with such strains of his <span class="nw">own—</span></div>
<div class="tri2">In a descant so solemn, so melting a <span class="nw">moan,—</span></div>
<div class="tri3">As Apollo might breathe from his musical <span class="nw">throne!—</span></div>
<div>But music’s no guard against mischief, ’tis found;</div>
<div>For this vocal Magician, this Tyrant of sound,</div>
<div>Has a trick—as with just indignation I <span class="nw">state—</span></div>
<div>To decoy little warblers, by mocking the mate;</div>
<div>But no sooner has manag’d his dupes to inveigle,</div>
<div>Than he scares out their souls with the screams of an Eagle.</div>
<div class="i1"><span class="ns">      </span>Now the tables were clear’d, and the Cock gave a <span class="nw">crow.—</span></div>
<div>At the signal, her Majesty bow’d to them <span class="nw">low—</span></div>
<div>Inuendo imperial! whence all were to gather,</div>
<div>That their room was desir’d—than their company rather.</div>
<div>So, with thanks to the King and his Consort for all,</div>
<div>In three flirts of a wing, they had emptied the Hall.</div>
</div>
